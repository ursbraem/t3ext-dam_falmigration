The migration tasks can be long running processes. Therefore they are executed using the command line dispatcher.

You can execute the dispathcer from the root of your website:

.. code-block:: bash

	php typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh

The available migration tasks can be found under the *extbase* cliKey:

.. code-block:: bash

	php typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase help

	The following commands are currently available:

Step 1: Converting DAM to FAL records
=====================================

This task goes through all DAM records and checks if they have a counterpart in the sys_file
table. If not, fetch the file (via the storage, which indexes the file directly)
and update the DAM DB table. Please note that this does not migrate the metadata.
This command can be run multiple times.
A sys_file record that was migrated from tx_dam holds the uid of the original tx_dam record uid in the _migrateddamuid field.

.. code-block:: bash

	php typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase dammigration:migratedamrecords

Step 2: Migrate metadata
========================

This task migrates DAM metadata to FAL metadata. It searches for all sys_file
records with a value in the _migrateddamuid field but without a title.

.. code-block:: bash

	php typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase dammigration:migratedammetadata

Step 3: Migrate RTE media tags
==============================

This task migrates the <media DAM_UID target title>Linktext</media> to
<link file:29643 - download>My link to a file</link>

.. code-block:: bash

	php typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase dammigration:migratemediatagsinrte

Step 4: Migrate DAM categories to FAL categories
================================================

This task migrates the tx_dam_cat records to sys_category records.

.. code-block:: bash

	php typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase dammigration:migratedamcategories

Step 5: Migrate categories to collections
=========================================

This task migrates all DAM categories to sys_file_collection records,
while also migrating the references if they don't exist yet as a pre-requisite,
there needs to be sys_file records that have been migrated from DAM.

.. code-block:: bash

	php typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase dammigration:migratedamcategoriestofalcollections

Step 6: Migrate EXT: dam_frontend
=================================

This task migrates all damfrontend_pi1 plugins to tt_content.uploads with file_collection.
Usually used in conjunction with / after migrateDamCategoriesToFalCollectionsCommand().

.. code-block:: bash

	php typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase dammigration:migratedamfrontendplugins

Step 7: Remove duplicate collection references
==============================================

.. note::
	This command is usually *NOT* necessary, only if something went wrong.

This task checks if there are multiple entries in sys_file_reference that contain
the same uid_local and uid_foreign with sys_file_collection references
and removes the duplicates.

.. code-block:: bash

	php typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase dammigration:cleanupduplicatefalcollectionreferences

Step 8: Migrate content relations
=================================

This task migrates relations to dam records that dam_ttcontent and dam_uploads introduced.

.. code-block:: bash

	php typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase dammigration:migraterelations

Step 9: Update the reference index
==================================

This task updates the reference index.

.. code-block:: bash

	php typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase dammigration:updatereferenceindex
